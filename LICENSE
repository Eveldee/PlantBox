This software contains a compiled, unmodified version of the WiringPi library
WiringPi is a GPIO access library written in C for the BCM2835 used in the 
Raspberry Pi. Itâ€™s released under the GNU LGPLv3 license and is usable from C 
and C++ and many other languages with suitable wrappers. A program that contains 
no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with 
the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses 
the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, 
and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. Raspberry IO is then,
by definition, "work that uses the Library"
